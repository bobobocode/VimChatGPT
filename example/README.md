# Socket Communication Demo

This Python demo showcases socket communication using TCP protocol. 

In this demo, we will create a server and client program that communicate with each other over the network using sockets. 

The server program listens for incoming client connections and then sends back an acknowledgement message to the client. 

The client program connects to the server and sends a message to it. 

Once the server receives the message, it sends an acknowledgement back to the client.

After installing Python 3, you can clone this repository and run the server.py file in one terminal window by typing `python3 server.py`. 
Then run the client.py file in another terminal window by typing `python3 client.py`. 

You should see output in both windows showing successful communication between the two programs.
